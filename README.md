## Introduction
Upon touching down the Mars Rover should relay it's correct location and direction.

### Moving Forward and backward
When the rover moves forward in the extant direction or it moves backward against the extant direction, the coordinates change to reflect the correct movement.

### Rotating Left and Right
When the rover rotates on its axis the direction the rover faces changes.

### Avoiding and detecting Obstacles
When the rover is just about to hit an obstacle, it immediately stops and reports it's heading and reason.

## Testing
To run the tests do `make test`
